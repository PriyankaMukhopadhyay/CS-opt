The above codes are for the paper "Synthesizing CS-optimal quantum circuits for arbitrary multi-qubit unitaries", by Priyanka Mukhopadhyay. The implementations are in Python.

Exact_CS_opt.py : This is the code for synthesizing exactly implementable unitaries. It implements EXACT-CS-OPT and its sub-routines. RANDOM-CHAN-REP is also implemented here.

Approx_CS_opt.py : This is the code for synthesizing approximately implementable unitaries. It implements APPROX-CS-OPT and its sub-routines.
